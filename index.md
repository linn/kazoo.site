# Kazoo User Guide

## Overview

Kazoo provides simple and intuitive way to play music all around your home. 

You can view your Music sources content without stopping what you are listening to.

Kazoo has been designed to control Linn DS systems and Kazoo Server. Kazoo will also work with 3rd party UPnP/AV media servers, but for the best music experience, we recommend using Kazoo with Kazoo Server.

Kazoo is available for iPad (iOS 6.0 and later), Windows (Windows XP SP3 and later) and Mac (Lion and later).

## Operation

Kazoo has support for homes that have multiple DS systems. Each system in the home should be given a unique room name. A system's room name can be configured using Linn Konfig.

## Dynamic grouping of rooms

Linn DS systems provides the ability to different play music in every room in the house, play the same music in all rooms or play the same music in a subset of rooms.

All rooms grouped together play the same music in perfect synchronisation.

1. Click ![Multiroom Tile](images/MultiroomTile.png)
2. Click ![Group Button](images/GroupButton.png) on the room you want to group with other rooms
3. Check the rooms you want to add to the group

![GroupDialog](images/GroupDialog.png)

* You can choose to either select and play the music you want and then group additional rooms or group rooms then select and play music
* Rooms added to a group will immediately start playing music in perfect synchronisation

## Permanent grouping of rooms

A permanent room is a room that plays the same music as another room but does not appear as a selectable room. An example of this behaviour is a dressing room connected to a bedroom. In most situations a listener would want both rooms to play the same music but be able to control the volume in each room independently.

To make a room a permanently part of a group you need to configure your Linn system using Konfig. To add a room to as a permanent member of a group you must configure the name of the room's Receiver source, (it's default name is Songcast), to be that of the group.

1. Go into Konfig and select the Room that will always be the source of the Music, we will call this the "sender" room
2. Select the *Device* tab and copy the "**Room**" name
3. Now select the permanent room, we will call this the "listening" room
4. Select the *Sources* tab in this "listening" room and select the Songcast input
5. Paste the Name of the "sender" into the Songcast name 


In our example of a bedroom, called "Bedroom", with a dressing room, called "Dressing Room", you would configure the name of the dressing room's Receiver source to "Bedroom".

* If a permanently grouped room is not playing the same as the group click ![Satellite Dialog](images/SatelliteButton.png) and ensure the room is ticked
<img style="floatcentre" src="images/PermanentGrouping.png"  />
* The permanent grouped icon will only be visible if there is a permanently grouped room associated with the currently selected room
* Rooms that are permanently grouped do not appear as an selectable room
