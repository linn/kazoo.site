# Kazoo User Guide

## Overview

Kazoo provides simple and intuative way to play music all around your home.

Kazoo has been designed to control Linn DS systems and Kazoo Server. Kazoo will also work with 3rd party UPnP/AV media server but for the best music experience we recommend using Kazoo with Kazoo Server.

Kazoo is available for iPad, Windows and Mac.

## Operation
